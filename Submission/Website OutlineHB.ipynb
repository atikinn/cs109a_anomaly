    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at streaming data, one may want to get an alert or notification when an anomoly is detected.  An anomoly is an \"event\" that is not considered normal or expected.  This could consist of streaming data that contains data outside the expected probability distribution or the fact that the properties of the distribution are changing themselves over time, such as variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The detection of anomolies can have various applications.  One maybe interested to have a model to detect and alert operators when a sensor is generating abnormal data, which could mean failure of a sensor or an issue with a production line for a product.  Anomoly detection could also be applied to other industries, such as finance, economics, and sciences. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Data Science Project, our group developed a modeled and explored the capabilities of anomoly detection method known as \"Testing Exchangeability Online\", proposed by Vladimir Vovk et al. (Vovk, 2003). Additionally, a \"Plug-in Martingales for Testing Exchability On-Line\" was also explored and implemented (Fedorova, 2012)."

    "### Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Their technique is essentially based on the assumption of exchangeability in the data where the joint distribution of observed features does not change under any order permutation of those observations if there is no anomaly in the data. Such approach is very close to the common iid (independent identically distributed) concept. In their technique, they create for each observation a p-value based on a measure of how close the newly observed data point is to all the previously observed ones. Based on the exchangeability assumption, a martingale can be constructed with all the p-values using a joining function (betting function) for all the calculated p-values. The behavior of this martingale is the metric used to assess the presence of an anomaly since any anomaly is assumed to be nonconformal with the exchangeability hypothesis. In this case a high martingale value is an indication of an anomaly (Vovk, 2003).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Vovk's et al. original work they proposed a power martingale as a betting function. This proposal is totally suitable when there are many small p-values in the sequence. In other words, the data distribution is consistent for most of the sampling time. When there are changes in the data distribution in a way that the calculated p-values are large, the martingale will not grow sufficiently enough when an anomaly occurs to reject the exchangeability assumption (Vovk, 2003).\n",
    "\n",
    "The martingale is in the form of: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_n = \\prod_{i=1}^{n}f_i(p_i), n = 1, 2, ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where <i>n</i> represent the observed data and $f_i(p_i)$ represents the betting function in the form of:\n",
    "$$f_i(p) = \\epsilon p^{(\\epsilon -1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where <i>p</i> are the calculated p-values and epsilon is a value between [0,1] (Vovk, 2003).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\epsilon$ is [0,1] and can be selected according to specific application (Ho, 2010). However, another approach where a mix of all possible $\\epsilon$ values within the range [0,1] can be applied. In this case, the Mix martingale (Vovk et al., 2003) will take the form of\n",
    "$$M_n = \\int_{0}^{1} M_n^{(\\epsilon)}d\\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis we will apply both approaches, the specified (tuned) $\\epsilon$ and the mixed martingale where the integration of all possible values of $\\epsilon$ is applied\n",
    "\n",
    "A variation of this method incorporates a new betting function, known as a \"plug-in\", in a form of:\n",
    "$$ \\rho_i =  \\hat{\\rho}(p_1, p_2,...,p_{i-1},p)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where this plug-in represent the joint distribution function of all observed p-values and is used instead of the power martingales.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis we will follow the method depicted in Fedorova et al.,2012 for the plugin martingale \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strangeness Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equations the <i>p</i> value is calculated based on  a measure called the strangness measure which is a measure for how far the data point is from the \"mass\". In our analysis we are considering three types:\n",
    " - The jump rate which measures how much change occurs in one time step compared to the average rate. This measure can be effective to detect outliers\n",
    " - The variation measure which measures how far a point is from a standarized distribution of the data. This approach is adapted for heterosdatastic anomaly detection\n",
    " - The last one which is a distance from he center of the data cluster. This approach is close to the k- mean clustering and is useful for multivariate data analysis\n",
    " \n",
    "For a strangness measure $\\alpha_n$, the <i>p</i> value can be computed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_i(p) = \\frac{\\#(i:\\alpha_i>\\alpha_n) + \\theta_n\\#(i:\\alpha_i=\\alpha_n)}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\#$ indicates the cardinality and $\\theta_n$ is a uniform random number between [0,1]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Implementation procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implemet the methodology described above three variants should be considered as mentioned in the literature:\n",
    " - The Power martingale with pre-determined $\\epsilon$ value\n",
    " - The mix martingale\n",
    " - The plugin martingale\n",
    " \n",
    "The implemetation will follow the algorithm described in Fedorova et al., 2012 according to the following steps:\n",
    " - Data pre-processing including normalization and the application of <i>t</i> step filter. The main purpose of this filter is to reduce the memory content\n",
    " \n",
    " - computation of the reference strangness value based on a benchmark data condition or a training data set\n",
    " - computation of the p-value based on the developped starngness measure\n",
    " - calculation of the martingale using the calculated p-value\n",
    "\n",
    "For better computational performance the logarithmic martingale will be considered instead of the actual martingale. Otherwise, the exponential increase in the martingale value will erradicate the method usefulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point forward, the expression martingale will always refere to the log(martingale)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final step, the change detection of the martigales will be considered as a metric to detect the change in the bid luck that can be a signature of an anomaly"

For this purpose both the wiind speed and the pressure were selected based on the completeness of the data and the xistance of obvious anomalies that could be good candidates for the demonstration. The following figure shows a sample of those two values and the types of anomalies that could be spotted from simple time series visualization\n",

In the same time, the windspeed data for the other buoys include obvious outliers. Accordingly, the windspeed data was considered for the outlier detection application and the surface pressure data was considered for floor change. The reason for selecting the surface pressure for floor change detection was the obvious floor change signature that can be seen in the 41047 buoy pressure data. Accordingly:\n",
    " - The 41041 buoy windspeed and pressure data were selected for training\n",

    "\n",
    "The three candidate strangness functions were applied for both cases and according to the results for each cae it was found that the jump rate is best suited for the outlier detection while the distance was convenient for the floor change detection. Based on the strangness value, three types of martingales were evaluated, a power martingale with pre selected $\\epsilon$, a mix martingale and a plugin martingale. The following figure displays the three martingales for both the outlier detection and floor change detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of $\\epsilon$ had to be adjusted for each case. A single value was not able to reproduce a satisfactory result for each anomaly type. An $\\epsilon = 0.1$ was chosen for the outlier detection and a value of $\\epsilon = 0.9$ was selected for the floor change detection. The following figure demonstrates the martingales produced for both the outlier detection and the floor change detection\n",

    "<img src=\"IMG/pre_mart.png\">\n",

    "it can be seen from the pictures that the power martingales are monotonically decreasing while the plugin martingale is somehow balanced in its behavior.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Change Detection Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the monotonicity of the martingale (except when a deviation from exchangeability occurrs) it is hard to quantify the amount of deviation caused by an anomaly and a mapping of the generated martingale to a measure space should be applied. For this purpose, the change detection was selected based on the fact that an anomaly will cause the martingale to change the loosing state or the winning state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The change detection method was adapted based on Ho, 2010. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two measures were proposed in the literature, the absolute value threshold value and the difference value threshold. In both cases the threshold is set based on the desired confidence and the type of the data under consideration. The absolute value threshold approach requires that the anomaly persists for a considerable amount of time to ensure that the threshold is violated with an acceptable confidence level. Therefore, the difference would be a more practical approach since it does not require this persistence which suites more intermittent anomalies which is mainly present in the data.  \n",

    " - The martingale method for exchangeability is not robust enough to detect more than one type of anomaly in a way than an overfitting situation can give somehow an acceptable detection percision.

    "### Application of Model to Detect Hurricane Matthew\n",
    "\n",
    "We adapted the Testing Exchangiability Online anomoly detection method to see if it could be used in a real  climatological application based on the buoy data. For this purpose, hurricane Matthew was benchmarked for this application for two reasons. The first, the magnitude of the storm: \"Hurricane Mathew was the most significant storm to hit the carribean area in the end September 2016 and into early October 2016 (The Weather Channel, 2016)\" \n",
    "\n",
    "With quick investigation it was found that two buoys in the Caribbean could be good candidates to build the model upon them, buoy 42059 and 42058 based on the fact that both of them were subjected to only one major event during the 2016 season which is hurricane Matthew and both endured a direct hit <a href=\"http://komonews.com/weather/scotts-weather-blog/buoy-takes-direct-strike-from-hurricane-matthew-measuring-its-weather-all-the-way\">(though one was affected more than the other)</a>. \n",
    "Buoy 42059 was used to investigate the different tasks and tune the model and buoy 42058 was seen more suitable for the validation. This is because if we train the model on the strongest evidence we may be underfitting. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A subset of the data features is selected based on the most evident signatures of a hurricane which are the wind speed, the wind gust, the surface pressure and the surface temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "Also the data was normalized and a delay filter is considered. The reason for this filter application is when the power martingale was applied to a long data set, the values calculated based on the raw signal or the normalized signal were causing an overflowing in the processing and it could not be done. The obvious reason was the memory content in the data. In the meantime, the one step differenced data showed better results when the step size increased from 1 to higher numbers that depends on the autocovariance function of the data. Accordingly, the step size was considered as a tuning parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Martingale Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of martingales were considered for this task: the power martingale with a pre-selected $\\epsilon$ and the mix martingale. The plugin martingale was dropped since it was taking a considerable amount of time for computation and as previously seen it is not convenient for this type of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "(file: Matthew_tuning.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of tuning the model, the data from buoy 42059 was considered. Since only one event is present in the data,  a cross validation technique cannot be applied. Hence, the tunning will be based on optimizing the model tunable parameters to achieve an optimum performance score for the hurricane detection. This score will be described later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The model tuning is different from the power martingale with fixed $\\epsilon$ and the Mix martingale. In the first case the tuning is performed for two parameters and in the second, the tuning is perfromed for the delay tp be applied for the diference filter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The criteria (or score) to be used for the tuning is in fact the maximum detectability of the hurricane. In other words, the model is tunned to achieve a maximum value of the change detection in the hrricane\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"IMG/heat_tune.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to this tuning, it was found that a delay value of 189 time steps with an epsilon value of 0.307 achieves the maximum detectability\n",

However, one difficulty existed which is the considerable amount of noise in the Martingale difference. For this reason, a smoothing function based on an exponential filter was added to the change detection difference. After this addition, the change detection method became a very convenient method to evaluate the hurricane signature in the data\n",

    " - The hurricane detection was performed using a subset of the data that are more representative to the type of the weather anomaly of interest.\n",
    " - It is important to mention that the selection of the multivariate set of signals is crucial. The huricanne signature could be diluted if some selected features does not record the huricane anomaly and hence the model performance could be severely hampered. This fact is also due to the non-robustness of the method"

    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we explored a method of identifying anomolies by Testing Exchangiability Online and a variation of this method using a Martingale Plug-in.  Based on these results, we can summarize the following findings:\n",
    " - This method is based on the exchangeability in the data which is basically cannot be guaranteed in time series data with memory content (significant autocovariance value at time lags > 1)\n",
    " - The main effect for this independance assumption was the fact that the method was not robust enough and excessive tunning was required to detect a specifc type of anomaly in a context similar to an overfitting situation for any clasifier or regression model where in this case the expected response is the anomaly to be detected\n",
    " - Some pre-processing of the data that can help reduce the memory component of the variance can mitigate the impact but not eliminating it\n",
    " - Another effect of the data variance memory component is the rapid absolute growth of the martingale which poses a defficiency for big data application. \n",
    " - The plugin martingale requires a considerable amount of computational resources to fit a distribution at each time step which makes it non practical for big data application\n",

    "** Long memory Content Data:**\n",

    "The method is not suitable unless a mapping is performed to the data to lessen the effect of the data variance memory content. The applied mapping in this analysis was the <i>t</i> time step difference.\n",

    "** Non regular sampling interval:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The method does not differentiate between regular and irregular sampling in a way the time component is not a factor in the martingale evaluation **Unless** the strangeness function considers the sampling frequency in any form such as the jump rate which is used in the presented analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Big data application:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be practical for big data application two factors should be satisfied:\n",
    " - Minimum memory content in the data variance to prevent any overflowing in evaluating the martingales.\n",
    " - Select a type of power martingale that is not computationaly exhaustive. In our case, the power maringale with pre-defined epsilon could be a good candidate since it does not includ the integration step of the mixed martingale and the exhaustive distribution fit of the plugin martingale. In our example it was found that for 22000 observation the computation time for each method was:\n",
    "  - 6 seconds for the power martingale with predefined $\\epsilon$\n",
    "  - 13 seconds for the mixed martingale\n",

    "The real interface between the actual data and the martingale computation is the strangeness function. If the strangenes function is capable to handle high dimension data, the method can be applied.\n",

    "The strangeness function can also accomodate some dimension reduction techniques like the principle component analysis for high dimension data.\n",

    "In our analysis we used a strangeness function based on the distancebetween clusters which was convenient to data with more than one dimension"

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from our exploration indicate that Testing Exchangiability Online is anomaly detector in a time series data that can have an acceptable performance if specifcally tailored for an anomaly type.\n",
    "\n",
    "A file containing the model to be used is linked here ( file : ProductionModel)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the shortfalls experienced throughout this analysis can be attributed to the fact that the excahngeability is better suited to a time series data with small memory component in the variance. The other, disadavtage comes fromthe martingale function that is based on a cumulative evaluation which is not sensitive enough to short transient anomalies. Some mitigation to the later condition can be achieved by selecting a specific strangeness function that can capture these types of anomalies with high confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the presented analysis, the following can be proposed as open points for investigation:\n",
    "\n",
    " - In order to consider the memory component, a strnagness function based on a window of data for different time steps can be adapted using the autocovariance function for the considered time steps as a feature that can be used for the strangeness calculation\n",
    " \n",
    " - The detection threshold determination was not clear in the literature and an arbitrary value was applied for the different cases of this analysis. We propose a threshold value calculated based on the actual martingale function slope. This approach will tie the threshold confidence to the a"
